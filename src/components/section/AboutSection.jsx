        <p className='p-3 mt-5 konten sm:p-0'>I recently graduated in Computer Science with a focus on Informatics Engineering from Dian Nuswantoro University Semarang. Throughout my studies, I actively participated in university organizations like DNCC and MPM-KM Dian Nuswantoro, fostering my passion for technology. Since my second year, I have been dedicated to becoming a skilled full-stack developer, mastering product development, UI/UX design, web and mobile client-side development, RESTful API creation, and Cloud Computing. I enjoy merging technology with creativity to craft visually appealing projects on the frontend and problem-solving to create efficient solutions on the backend.</p>
